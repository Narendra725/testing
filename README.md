# testing
a test repository to understand the working of the github

This is the first line written from the main

This line is written after the creation of feature branch.

It is obvious that you can create a pull request to merge the changes in the feature branch  to the main branch.

what if a change is made in the main branch , can it be automatically merged in to the feature branch
or a new pull request should be raised?

Answer is that the pull request must be raised rom the main branch and once it is raised you must open the pull requests and merge those 
changes in to the feature branch.however you would see the line in your feature branch saying that it is behind the main branch by 
specific number of commits, and that is how you will come to know that there have been some changes in the main branch(the branch based on which
you have ceated the feature branch).

suppose that you have two feature branches and you updated a file in feature1 branch and you want to create a pull request from feature1 branch to feature2 branch will it work?

Yes , ofcourse it will 

Suppose that we have 20 branches in a repository , and one of the branches have done the changes,how does one knows if there are any changes in the repository ?

If a change is made in any of the branches you would see the highlighting sayiong that there are changes from this branch as shown ....
